Anyone (except the User and the Author) with access to a running instance of the Software with administrative/manager permissions and/or with access to the Software source code is defined as a third-party user (the “Third-Party”).

Software access

This Agreement grants access to all present, past and future available Software releases to the User. The Author reserves the right to limit or restrict the User access and usage of any given Software release or releases. The User shall only use the Software versions to which access has been granted by the Author.

The User shall access the Software only through this website and using the User account login. The User shall only use the Software releases available in the User account. Any Software release not available in the User account will be forbidden to the User.

Terms, termination, and modification

The User may use the Software until any participating party terminates this Agreement as set forth in this paragraph. Either party may terminate the Agreement at any time upon written notice to the other party. Upon termination, all licenses granted to the User will expire, and the User shall immediately uninstall and cease all use of the Software. The Sections entitled “Warranty,” “Indemnification” and “Limitation of liability” will survive any termination of this Agreement.

The Author may modify the Software and this Agreement with notice to you either in email or by publishing content on the Software website, including but not limited to changing the functionality or appearance of the Software. This modification will become binding on you unless you terminate this Agreement.

Indemnification

By accepting the Agreement the User agrees to indemnify and otherwise hold harmless the Author, its officers, employers, agents, subsidiaries, affiliates and other partners from any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages arising out of, relating to, or resulting from your use of the Software or any other matter relating to the Software.

Limitation of liability

The User declares to expressly understand and agree that the Author shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to damages for loss of profits, good will, use, data or other intangible losses (even if the Author has been advised of the possibility of such damages). Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations may not apply to the User. In no event will the Author’s total cumulative damages exceed the fees you paid to the Author under this agreement in the most recent twelve-month period.

The User assume all risk associated with the quality, performance, installation and use of the software including, but not limited to, the risks of program errors, damage to equipment, loss of data or software programs, or unavailability or interruption of operations. The User is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of use of the Software and assume all risks associated with its use or misuse.
